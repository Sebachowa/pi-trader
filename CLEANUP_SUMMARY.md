# ðŸ§¹ Project Cleanup Summary

## What Was Done

### 1. **Consolidated Duplicate Directories**
- Removed confusion between `pi-trader/` and `trader-pi/`
- Moved the best implementation (trader-pi) directly to root level
- Integrated valuable components from pi-trader (Position and TradingMetrics classes)

### 2. **Enhanced Core Engine**
- Added `core/trading_metrics.py` with Position and TradingMetrics dataclasses
- Updated `core/engine.py` to use the new metrics system
- Added real-time performance tracking and metrics calculation

### 3. **Removed Redundant Components**
- Deleted `pi-trader/` directory
- Deleted `trader-pi/` directory (after moving contents to root)
- Removed `_archive/` directory
- Removed old `start_autonomous_trading.sh` and `stop_autonomous_trading.sh` scripts

### 4. **Updated Documentation**
- Rewrote README.md to reflect the simplified structure
- Focused on Raspberry Pi deployment as the primary use case
- Clear instructions for setup and deployment

## Current Structure

```
trader/
â”œâ”€â”€ .github/           # GitHub Actions for deployment
â”œâ”€â”€ config/            # Configuration files
â”œâ”€â”€ core/              # Core trading engine
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ engine.py      # Main trading engine (enhanced)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ monitor.py     # System monitoring
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ risk.py        # Risk management
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ trading_metrics.py  # NEW: Position and metrics tracking
â”œâ”€â”€ scripts/           # Utility scripts
â”œâ”€â”€ strategies/        # Trading strategies
â”œâ”€â”€ deploy_to_pi.sh    # Direct deployment script
â”œâ”€â”€ run.py            # Main entry point
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements-pi.txt # Lightweight dependencies
â””â”€â”€ README.md         # Updated documentation
```

## Benefits

1. **Cleaner Structure**: Everything at root level, no nested projects
2. **Single System**: One unified trading system optimized for Raspberry Pi
3. **Better Performance Tracking**: Enhanced metrics with Position class
4. **Easier Maintenance**: No duplicate code or confusing directories
5. **Clear Purpose**: Focused on 24/7 autonomous trading on Raspberry Pi

## Next Steps

1. Configure your API keys in `config/config.json`
2. Deploy to your Raspberry Pi using GitHub Actions or `deploy_to_pi.sh`
3. Monitor performance through the web dashboard
4. Enjoy passive income from autonomous trading! ðŸš€
